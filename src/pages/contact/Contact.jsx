        Getting Started Using about:tracing Recording Tracing Runs; start with
        this, it's prerequisite for using about:tracing. How to use the Frame
        Viewer to Bust Jank; read this next, to understand how to diagnose
        rendering performance problems. Jank Case Study 1; then read this, for
        further examples of how to effectively use about:tracing in conjunction
        with the Dev Tools timeline Note that to understand what's happening in
        trace events you'll need a basic understanding of how the browser works.
        The above articles provide enough to get started, but it's recommended to
        first read at minimum: The Rendering Critical Path for a little more
        background, and... Anatomy of Jank for precise explanations of various
        rendering performance problems Further reading: A presentation from pdr@
        on how to debug the graphics stack with tracing Frame Viewer Basics, a
        short guide for how to navigate the frame viewer view. This is more
        succinct but less informative than frame viewer how-to above. Saving Skia
        Pictures; this is useful if you want to capture isolated SkPictures for
        the Skia team. Tracking memory allocations with memory-infra tracing Even
        further reading: How to Understand about:tracing results (somewhat out of
        date; refer to the Frame Viewer how-to instead) Contributing to
        about:tracing Start by perusing the Tracing Ecosystem Explainer to
        understand the various different pieces of code involved. To instrument
        Chrome and add your own custom traces, see Instrumenting Chromium or
        Javascript code to get more detail. To add functionality to the
        about:tracing viewer itself, see contributing to trace-viewer.
        trace-viewer lives in its own repository on GitHub, not in the Chromium
        tree. Please file bugs as you find them! If you find any bugs, please let
        us know. You review the known bugs as well.
